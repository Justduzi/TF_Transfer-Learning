#Transfer Learning with TensorFlow
This project demonstrates how to use transfer learning with TensorFlow to create a custom image classifier for a food recognition task. Transfer learning involves leveraging a pre-trained neural network and fine-tuning it for a specific problem, which can save a lot of time and resources compared to training a model from scratch.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a subset of the Food-101 dataset, which contains images of 101 different food categories. We downloaded a smaller version of the dataset that includes only 10 food categories, each with 75 training images and 250 test images.

#Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need to have python and jupyrter notebook


#Results
Our transfer learning model achieved an accuracy of 89.8% on the test set, which is a good result considering that we only used a small subset of the original dataset.
